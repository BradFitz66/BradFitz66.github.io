## Red Grove Academy
Red Grove Academy was my first actual attempt at a solo game project in Unity. It was to be an adventure game set in a boarding school with the story revolving around a mystery within the school. I first started it in 2018 during my time at Southampton City College doing the Game Design course.

The game went through many revisions. From complete overhauls, to different school designs, to different character designs, to different story ideas, e.t.c. The game also evolved as I did as a developer. As I became more competent as a programmer, understood how to properly utilize design patterns like observer, singleton, chain-of-responsibility, the game got these incorporated into it's codebase to create a pretty modular codebase that I still use parts of in other projects today (such as a custom game event manager).

Unfortunately, as I spent more time in this project, the more it became obvious to me I didn't have the skills as a solo developer to pull it off. While the programming side of the game (gameplay systems, etc) was pretty much set in concrete and complete, I still had to:

* Do character design and animation
* Finish the school design
* Create up to 50+ unique characters to spread across the map of the school to make it not feel empty (not all of thes characters would have had a pivotal role in the game, however)
* Actually flesh out and create a proper story to the game
* Marketing

and I realized that I was never going to finish this game. I somewhat always knew this, as the game essentially just became a project to practice my 3D modelling and programming skills near the end of development, but I still had fun making it. It taught me a lot of essential skills as a developer and is one of my most proud projects. I hope to revisit it and finish it one day when I feel I have expanded my skillset.

Below is a bunch of screenshots I created of the game during it's development (not in chronological order) as-well as a brief description of what they show.
